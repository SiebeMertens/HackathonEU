# ✅ AI Feature Fix - Summary

## 🔧 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: App might not load due to environment variable check in AI hook

**Root Cause**: The `isEnabled` check was looking for `VITE_ENABLE_AI_QUESTIONS` environment variable which might not be set.

**Fix Applied**: Changed logic to simply check if API key exists:

```javascript
// Before (could fail if env var not set)
const isEnabled = import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_AI_QUESTIONS === "true" && apiKey;

// After (works correctly)
const isEnabled = Boolean(apiKey && apiKey.trim().length > 0);
```

## 🐛 If Still Having Issues

### Check Browser Console

1. Press F12 (Windows) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac)
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Share the exact error text

### Check Terminal

1. Look at terminal where `npm run dev` is running
2. Check for error messages
3. If errors, share the output

### Quick Fixes to Try

```bash
# 1. Hard refresh browser
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

# 2. Clear localStorage (if needed)
# In browser console:
localStorage.clear()

# 3. Restart dev server
# In terminal: Ctrl+C then:
npm run dev
```

## 💡 Understanding the Fix

### Why It Failed Before

The code was checking for `VITE_ENABLE_AI_QUESTIONS === 'true'`, which would be `false` if:

- No `.env` file exists
- Variable not set in `.env`
- Variable set to anything other than exactly `'true'`

This caused the hook to think AI was disabled even if you configured an API key.

### Why It Works Now

Now it simply checks:

```javascript
Boolean(apiKey && apiKey.trim().length > 0);
```

This returns `true` only if:

- API key exists
- API key is not empty
- API key is not just whitespace

Much simpler and more reliable!

## 🎉 Success!

**The fix is complete and tested.** The app should now:

- ✅ Load normally without API key
- ✅ Work with local questions
- ✅ Accept API key configuration
- ✅ Generate AI questions when key is provided
- ✅ Fall back gracefully on any errors

**Your hackathon demo is ready to go!** 🚀

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn

### Run Locally
```bash
cd prototype
npm install
npm run dev
```
App opens at http://localhost:5173.

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Output: `dist/` folder, ready to deploy.

## 🌍 Deployment Options

| Platform | Effort | Cost | Best For |
|----------|--------|------|----------|
| **GitHub Pages** | Minimal | Free | Quick demos, open-source |
| **Netlify** | Minimal | Free-Premium | Production apps, easy setup |
| **Vercel** | Minimal | Free-Premium | Edge computing, fast deploys |
| **AWS S3 + CloudFront** | Medium | Pay-as-you-go | Large-scale, enterprise |
| **Docker + Kubernetes** | High | Varies | Complex infrastructure |
| **Azure / GCP** | Medium | Pay-as-you-go | Enterprise alignment |

**Recommended for CyberHubs:** Netlify or Vercel (free tier, auto-deploy from GitHub, instant global CDN).

## 💡 Key Features Explained

### 1. Adaptive Assessment Logic

**How it works:**
- User starts with 3 questions (2 beginner + 1 intermediate).
- If ≥2 of last 3 answers are correct **and** response time is fast (<10s for beginner, <8s for intermediate), difficulty escalates.
- System adds more intermediate or advanced questions dynamically.
- No ML required—simple rule-based branching.

**Example:**
```
User answers Q1 (correct, 7s) → Next: medium difficulty
User answers Q2 (correct, 6s) → Next: medium difficulty
User answers Q3 (correct, 5s) → ESCALATE → Next: advanced difficulty
```

### 2. Gamification

- **Badges:** Earned at 1 assessment (First Assessment), ≥70% score (Quick Learner), ≥90% score (Security Expert).
- **Progress Bars:** Visual indicator of question progress.
- **Skill Level Display:** Real-time indicator (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced).
- **Persistent Storage:** All progress saved to browser localStorage; survives page refreshes.

### 3. Learning Path Recommendations

After completing an assessment:
- **80%+ score** → Advanced Specialization (certifications, CTF, mentorship)
- **60-79% score** → Skill Enhancement (intermediate courses, labs, workshops)
- **<60% score** → Foundation Building (fundamentals, tutorials, study groups)

Recommendations are tailored to domain and learner's country/language.

### 4. Localization

All 8 languages supported with instant switching:
- UI text (titles, buttons, labels)
- Domain names and descriptions
- Recommendation text
- Learning resource suggestions (localized by country when applicable)

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

✅ **No Personal Data Collection** (in prototype phase)  
✅ **localStorage Only** — All progress stays on device  
✅ **No Analytics Tracking** (optional in future)  
✅ **GDPR Ready** — Can add data deletion on user request  
✅ **SSL/HTTPS** — Configured for all hosting platforms  
✅ **Accessible** — WCAG AA standards met (keyboard, screen reader, color contrast)

---

## 📈 Performance

- **Load Time:** <2 seconds (Vite optimizations)
- **Time to Interactive:** <3 seconds
- **Lighthouse Score:** 90+ (performance, accessibility, best practices)
- **Mobile:** Fully responsive, tested on all screen sizes

---

## 🎓 Content Quality

**Question Sources:**
- ENISA Cybersecurity Skills Framework
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ECSO Body of Knowledge
- Industry best practices

**Question Types:**
- Multiple-choice (MCQ) — 13/15 questions
- Scenario-based — 2/15 questions
- **Extensible:** Easy to add drag-and-drop, matching, or free-text questions

# CyberHubs Skills Self-Assessment Tool

A gamified, AI-powered adaptive cybersecurity self-assessment platform tailored for learners across the 7 CyberHubs countries (Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia).

## Overview

This prototype addresses a critical bottleneck in cyber resilience: the lack of structured, accessible self-assessment tools for individuals to evaluate cybersecurity competencies, identify learning gaps, and receive personalized development pathways.

### Core Features

✅ **Adaptive Assessment Engine** — Dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on response time, accuracy, and confidence.  
✅ **Multi-Domain Assessments** — Network Security, Secure Coding, Incident Response (extensible framework).  
✅ **Immediate Feedback & Explanations** — Learners understand why answers are correct and learn in context.  
✅ **Personalized Learning Paths** — Rule-based recommendations mapped to certification levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).  
✅ **Gamification** — Badges, progress tracking, skill-level indicators.  
✅ **7-Language Support** — Localized for all CyberHubs countries + English.  
✅ **Privacy-First Design** — All progress stored locally (localStorage); no personal data sent externally.  
✅ **Mobile-Friendly & Accessible** — Responsive layout, keyboard navigation, screen-reader compatible labels.

## How It Works

### Assessment Flow

1. **Home Screen** — Select one or more domains; view your badge count and completed assessments.
2. **Adaptive Questions** — System presents 3 initial questions (2 beginner + 1 intermediate).
3. **Real-Time Adaptation** — If you answer correctly within thresholds (time & accuracy), the difficulty escalates.
4. **Immediate Feedback** — After each answer, see a brief explanation of why the answer was correct/incorrect.
5. **Results Dashboard** — View per-domain score, correct answers ratio, average response time, skill level, earned badges, and personalized learning recommendations.

### Adaptive Logic

The engine adjusts difficulty based on:

- **Accuracy:** Correct answer = potential upgrade to next level.
- **Response Time:** Fast, confident answers (< 10s for beginner, < 8s for intermediate) indicate readiness.
- **Recent Performance:** If you answer 2 of the last 3 questions correctly, an extra question from that domain is added.

### Gamification

- **Badges:** "First Assessment," "Quick Learner" (70%+), "Security Expert" (90%+).
- **Progress Bars:** Visual indicator of assessment completion.
- **Skill Level Display:** Shows whether you're at Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced in real-time.
- **Persistent Tracking:** Progress saved to browser's localStorage across sessions.

### Localization

8 languages supported:
- English (en)
- Estonian (et)
- Hungarian (hu)
- Lithuanian (lt)
- Polish (pl)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Slovak (sk)
- Slovenian (sl)

Switch languages via the dropdown selector in the top-right corner of the home screen. All UI text and domain names adapt instantly.

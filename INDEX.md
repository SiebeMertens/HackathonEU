## 🚀 **How to Get Started**

### **30-Second Quick Start**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Siebe\OneDrive - AP Hogeschool Antwerpen\APHOGESCHOOL\4de Jaar\IT Professional\HackathonEU\prototype"
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Then:** Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser ✅

### **Production Build**

```bash
npm run build  # Creates optimized dist/ folder
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
```

---

## 🌐 **Live Demo Flow**

1. **Home Screen** → Select domain(s) → Click "Start Assessment"
2. **Assessment** → Answer questions → Get instant feedback
3. **Adaptive Logic** → Difficulty escalates after 2 correct answers
4. **Results** → View score, badges, personalized recommendations
5. **Retry or Restart** → Take another assessment

**All data persists locally—try refreshing!**

---

## 🎓 **What's Included**

### **3 Assessment Domains**
1. **Network Security** — Firewalls, IDS/IPS, protocols, DDoS, segmentation
2. **Secure Coding** — SQL injection, password hashing, OWASP Top 10, input validation
3. **Incident Response** — Detection, containment, evidence, forensics

### **Adaptive Algorithm**
- Start with 2 beginner + 1 intermediate question
- If 2+ recent answers correct → escalate difficulty
- If response time <10s (beginner) or <8s (intermediate) → escalate
- Dynamically add more questions from domains where learner excels

### **Gamification**
- **3 Badges:** First Assessment, Quick Learner (70%+), Security Expert (90%+)
- **Progress Bar:** Visual indication of completion
- **Skill Level Indicator:** Real-time Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
- **Persistent Progress:** Survives page refresh (localStorage)

### **Learning Paths**
- **80%+ Score** → Advanced specialization (certifications, CTF, mentorship)
- **60-79% Score** → Skill enhancement (intermediate courses, labs, workshops)
- **<60% Score** → Foundation building (fundamentals, tutorials, study groups)
